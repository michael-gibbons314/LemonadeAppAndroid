# LemonadeAppAndroid
My first android "app" to show use of basic views, constraint layouts, using functions, etc.

This is a project from developer.android.com on android basics in kotlin, and is the project for the end of the first pathway.

Download the folder, unzip it, and open it in android studio to view :)
